<h1 align="center">Hi! I'm Zhengji Li</h1>

#  About Me:
I am a sophmore at Del Norte High School in San Diego, California. I am currently interested in understanding how the software in a program interacts with the hardware in a machine, as well as the languages assembly, C, and C++.


##  What I'm Up To

- Learning what I'm interested in
- Coding, for the CSSE class as well as making discord bots I find intresting.
- Doing things I find intrest in, such as contributing to the Valorant addiction, as well as going outside to finally touch grass after pushing to Iron 1 (lowest rank in Valorant).

# Fun Stuff:
"Hi, my name is devin. I'm in ninth grade, and like you, I had to take the diagnostic."

The results of the diagnostic decides what lessons you get. The diagnostic shows what you know, and what you need to work on.

I remember the last diagnostic I took, it was hard.

The diagnostic will feel challenging, you may see questions you don't know how to answer because you haven't learned them.

There were some questions I knew and some questions I didn't know, but I didn't give up. I tried my best and moved on. When I finished I got lessons that were right for me. 

The diagnostic is not a typical test. Not all students will see the same questions, every student should get around half the questions correct, that's okay!

Some of my friends rushed and got lessons that weren't right for them, they asked me what I did. Here are five things I shared with them

I didn't give up.

Some of the questions may seem tricky but I made sure to read the whole question.

Some of the questions I didn't know the answer too after thinking hard and working the problem on a piece of paper. I took my best guess.

Before I hit the done button, I checked my answer to make sure it was right. I changed a few of my answers the way

I took my time, once I finished really fast but then got lessons that weren't right for me.

Warning some students guess without reading the choices, if you do this you may get lessons that are too easy for you and will be a waste of your time, you may even have to take it again. You might wanna give up or rush, don't. If you try your best you might get the right lessons for you.

:D
when ptsd?

I'm so glad I don't need to hear this any more :D
